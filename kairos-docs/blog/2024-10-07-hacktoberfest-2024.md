![Kairos' Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e79ca5ed-97fe-4eaf-b31c-1fd01ff457f0)

I can't believe it's already October. I've been so busy following up on different events where we've brought some of the Kairos love that I forgot about [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com). Thankfully, the month isn't over so let's get our hands dirty!

Like [last year](https://kairos.io/blog/2023/09/26/hacktoberfest-2023/) Kairos is taking part in this event. This means that you can open PRs in any of our repositories, and we'll make sure to tag them correctly so they count towards your progress (please contact us if this is not the case).

If you'd like to participate, start by looking at the tickets with the [hacktoberfest label](https://github.com/kairos-io/kairos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest), but you can hack on any other ticket and we'll be happy to add the tag for you.

This year, we will offer Kairos t-shirts and stickers to the first 10 contributions. So don't wait too long to participate.

Disclaimer: Only accepted PRs will count and Kairos is just an open-source project and we cannot guarantee that we can send swag anywhere in the world.
