## Key Features and Updates

## Unified Kernel Images (UKI)
- Measured systemd-sysext: Introducing the ability to measure systemd extensions, enhancing security and integrity.
- Verify Upgrade Artifacts Signature: Ensuring the authenticity of upgrade EFI files before applying updates.
- Autoenroll Keys: Automatically enroll keys during live CD boot in setup mode for seamless initialization.
- Slim Artifacts to address memory constrains on some devices.

## Base Distribution Updates

## Expanded Support

- HTTPS Support for IPXE Artifacts: Enhancing security with HTTPS support for IPXE artifacts.

## Potential Breaking Changes

By default, UKI artifacts now exclude Linux modules and firmware to reduce file
size for better EFI compatibility. This may impact hardware support. Review the
full changelog on GitHub for details on how to customize these artifacts to
meet specific hardware needs. Read more about this on the [release notes](https://kairos.io/v3.1.0/docs/).
