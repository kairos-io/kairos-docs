# Introduction

kdump is a feature of the Linux kernel that creates crash dumps in the event of a kernel crash. When triggered, kdump exports a memory image (also known as vmcore) that can be analyzed for the purposes of debugging and determining the cause of a crash.


In the event of a kernel crash, kdump preserves system consistency by booting another Linux kernel, which is known as the dump-capture kernel, and using it to export and save a memory dump. As a result, the system boots into a clean and reliable environment instead of relying on an already crashed kernel that may cause various issues, such as causing file system corruption while writing a memory dump file

This is why we need a clean initramfs that disables most of the modules and mounts the persistent partition into the `/var/crash` route in order to store the dumps over reboots

# Requirements

 - A custom image that builds a simple,small initrd with the kdump module and that mounts persistent to store the dump
 - A service override to skip the kdump service rebuilding the initrd on an immutable system

# Steps

 - Build the custom derivative artifact
 - Build an iso from that artifact
 - Install the iso
 - Check that kdump is enabled and works


### Building the custom derivative

We will keep this short as there is more docs about building your own derivatives than what we can go in this tutorial like the [Customizing page]({{%relref "/docs/advanced/customizing" %}})

The main step is to build a clean initrd that has the kdump module and can mount persistent to store the kernel dump.


```dockerfile
FROM quay.io/kairos/opensuse:leap-15.6-core-amd64-generic-v3.1.2

# Install kdump
RUN zypper ref && zypper in -y kdump kexec-tools makedumpfile
# Build initramfs with kdump module on it
RUN kernel=$(ls /lib/modules | head -n1) && depmod -a "${kernel}" && \
            dracut -N -f /var/lib/kdump/initrd "${kernel}" -a kdump \
            --omit "plymouth resume usrmount zz-fadumpinit immucore kairos-network kairos-sysext" --compress "xz -0 --check=crc32" \
            --mount "/dev/disk/by-label/COS_PERSISTENT /kdump/mnt/var/crash ext4 rw,relatime"
# On opensuse the path to the kernel is hardcoded so we need to soft link it to our kernel
RUN ln -s /boot/vmlinuz /var/lib/kdump/kernel
# Enable services. early service is the one on the initramfs
RUN systemctl enable kdump-early && systemctl enable kdump
```

We are generating a new initrd and storing it on `/var/lib/kdump/initrd` as the kdump service will look into that directory to find the kernel and initrd needed to exec into.
We are using the following options to generate a simple, clean initrd:
 - `-a kdump`: adds the kdump module explicitly to the initramfs.
 - `--omit`: omits modules from initrd. This is to have a clean, simple initramfs.
 - `--compress`: Compresses the initrd to keep it small.
 - `--mount`: Explicitly mount the PERSISTENT partition into `/kdump/mnt/var/crash` so kdump can store the dump



Then we generate a new artifact using that dockerfile:
```bash
$ docker build -t kdump-kairos .

```

### Build an iso from that artifact

Again, this tutorial does not cover this part deeply as there are docs providing a deep insight onto this like the [AuroraBoot page]({{%relref "/docs/reference/auroraboot" %}})

```bash
$ docker run -v "$PWD"/build-iso:/tmp/auroraboot -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm -ti quay.io/kairos/auroraboot --set container_image="docker://kdump-kairos" --set "disable_http_server=true" --set "disable_netboot=true" --set "state_dir=/tmp/auroraboot"
2:38PM INF Pulling container image 'kdump-kairos' to '/tmp/auroraboot/temp-rootfs' (local: true)
2:38PM INF Generating iso 'kairos' from '/tmp/auroraboot/temp-rootfs' to '/tmp/auroraboot/build'
```


### Install the iso

Then we burn the resulting ISO to a dvd or usb stick and boot it normally. 

**In order to have kdump working properly, we need to reserve a chunk of memory from the system so it can dump correctly**. Several tools exist for this like `kdumptool` which will give us some approximated values to reserve if running on the machine. A safe value might be `512M high` and `72M low`

This values need to be passed to the kernel in the cmdline so kdump knows what memory it has to work with. The easiest way is to set the `install.grub_options.extra_cmdline` value in the [cloud-config]({{%relref "/docs/reference/configuration" %}}) during install.

```yaml
#cloud-config

install:
  auto: true
  reboot: true
  grub_options:
    extra_cmdline: "crashkernel=512M,high crashkernel=72M,low"

stages:
  initramfs:
    - name: "Set user and password"
      users:
        kairos:
          passwd: "kairos"
    - name: "Set hostname"
      hostname: kairos-{{ trunc 4 .Random }}
```

### Check that kdump is enabled and works

Once the system has been installed there is 2 services that can be checked to see if kdump is correctly enabled. `kdump-early` and `kdump` services run in initrafms and userspace respectively and both of them should be in status `Active` after booting:

```bash
$ systemctl status kdump-early
* kdump-early.service - Load kdump kernel early on startup
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/kdump-early.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2024-09-09 14:41:02 UTC; 19min ago
   Main PID: 1556 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 68ms

Sep 09 14:41:02 kairos-cfig systemd[1]: Starting Load kdump kernel early on startup...
Sep 09 14:41:02 kairos-cfig systemd[1]: Finished Load kdump kernel early on startup.

$ systemctl status kdump      
* kdump.service - Load kdump kernel and initrd
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/kdump.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2024-09-09 14:41:03 UTC; 20min ago
   Main PID: 1672 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 64ms

Sep 09 14:41:03 kairos-cfig systemd[1]: Starting Load kdump kernel and initrd...
Sep 09 14:41:03 kairos-cfig systemd[1]: Finished Load kdump kernel and initrd.
```

Now we know that our systems is kdump ready and in case of a kernel crash it will dump the crash allowing us to troubleshoot it.

The dumps will be stored in `/usr/local/DATE` and will survive reboots
```bash
$ ls -ltra /usr/local/2024-09-09-15-03/
total 79488
drwxr-xr-x 9 root root     4096 Sep  9 15:03 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    74108 Sep  9 15:03 dmesg
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     4096 Sep  9 15:03 .
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 81305093 Sep  9 15:03 vmcore
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root      320 Sep  9 15:03 README.txt
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
You can manually trigger a crash by running `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger`

Note that this will immediately crash your machine, dump the kernel and restart so make sure that everything is ready for the sudden crash.
