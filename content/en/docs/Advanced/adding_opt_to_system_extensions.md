## Using /opt with System Extensions

By default, Kairos does not include `/opt` as a system extension (`sysext`) overlay hierarchy. This is because in normal runtime, `/opt` is writable and bind-mounted to the persistent partition, allowing users and applications to freely write data that persists across reboots.

However, when a system extension is loaded that includes a `/opt` hierarchy, the behavior of that directory changes: it becomes **read-only**, overridden by the overlay from the system extension image. This is a consequence of how `systemd-sysext` currently operates and reflects a known upstream limitation.

### Why `/opt` Might Be Needed

If your use case includes deploying system extensions that provide optional software, plugins, or third-party tools installed under `/opt`, you might need to explicitly enable `/opt` as a supported hierarchy for sysext overlays.

This can be done by configuring the environment variable `SYSTEMD_SYSEXT_HIERARCHIES` to include `/opt`, and ensuring that the `systemd-sysext` service uses this setting both at runtime and in the initramfs phase.

Once `/opt` is included in the sysext overlay, the directory becomes read-only as soon as any system extension mounts a `/opt` subtree. This can break applications or scripts expecting to write to `/opt`.

As of systemd 255, there is no way to mark overlay hierarchies as mutable. However, upstream efforts are underway to address this in [systemd 256](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd-sysext.html#Mutability) and beyond, allowing finer control over the mutability of sysext mount points.

## Enabling `/opt` in System Extensions: Cloud-Init Configuration

To allow system extensions to provide content under `/opt`, you can modify the `systemd-sysext` configuration using Kairos cloud config.

Below is an example cloud-init YAML you can embed in your OEM configuration or custom image. It ensures that `/opt` is registered as a sysext hierarchy both in normal and Trusted Boot installations. In here we are overriding the existing files to include the `/opt` directory in the `SYSTEMD_SYSEXT_HIERARCHIES` environment variable that Kairos sets by default.

```yaml
