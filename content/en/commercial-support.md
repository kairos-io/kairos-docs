# New Options for Enhanced Reliability and Peace of Mind

We are excited to announce that Kairos now offers commercial support options! As the project continues to grow, we understand that some teams need more than just community-driven, best-effort assistance to meet their operational requirements. That’s why we’re introducing paid support for those who require guaranteed response times, expert troubleshooting, and long-term maintenance.

## Spectro Cloud: Our First Official Support Partner

We’re proud to welcome [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/) as the first commercial support partner for Kairos. As a company that has been involved with Kairos since its inception, Spectro Cloud brings extensive experience with edge systems in production environments. Their expertise will benefit users who need dependable support for their Kubernetes-based edge deployments. Get in touch with Spectro Cloud to learn more about their support offerings.

## Community Support Remains Unchanged

For those who prefer to stick with the community support model, nothing is changing. We will continue to engage with our users on GitHub and in our Slack channel, providing assistance, addressing bugs, and implementing new features as we have always done—on a best-effort basis. The introduction of commercial support is intended to complement, not replace, our commitment to community support.

## What Does This Mean for You?

1. Greater Flexibility: Now you can choose between community support or commercial support based on your requirements.
2. Enhanced Expertise: Spectro Cloud's involvement ensures that you're backed by a partner who understands the unique challenges of edge computing.
3. Future Partner Expansion: We plan to add new partners over time, giving you even more options to choose from.

## Want to Become a Kairos Support Partner?

As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox Project, Kairos is part of a stable, open-source ecosystem that is here for the long haul.
