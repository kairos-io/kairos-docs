Excitement abounds as we roll out Kairos v2.3, the latest iteration of our project, packed with new features and enhancements. This update shines a spotlight on the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).

FIPS, a set of standards governing document processing, encryption algorithms, and other IT standards for non-military government agencies and contractors, is now an integral part of Kairos. The addition of a FIPS generic and Ubuntu-specific framework image marks a significant milestone in our journey to offer a secure and reliable Linux distribution. Furthermore, we've furnished examples to facilitate building from scratch on Ubuntu, Fedora, and RockyLinux.

This release also heralds a series of updates to the diverse Kairos flavors. The Ubuntu core images now stand at version 23.04, AlmaLinux has joined our flavor offerings, and openSUSE Leap has been upgraded to version 15.5.

Several bugs have been squashed to ensure a seamless experience for our users. This release contains bugfixes and general enhancements to the Kairos fundaments to enhance its stability.

Kairos v2.3 is a testament to our commitment to delivering a more secure, stable, and versatile experience for all users. We eagerly await your feedback and suggestions. Your insights are invaluable in our quest to make Kairos the best it can be. So, dive into Kairos v2.3 and share your thoughts!
