# Growing Stronger: Introducing Commercial Support for Kairos

Kairos has always been more than just a Linux distro‚Äîit's a bold idea: bring the power and flexibility of Kubernetes to the edge, with a truly immutable, secure, and cloud-native operating system anyone can use, contribute to, and trust.

Over the past few years, we've seen Kairos go from idea to implementation, and from experimentation to production. Today, it's running in large-scale, real-world deployments across diverse edge use cases. But more importantly‚Äîit's been growing as a community.

And today, we're excited to share a new milestone in that growth:  
üëâ **Kairos now has official commercial support**, provided by the project's creator and lead sponsor, [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support).

But before we dive into what that means, let's step back and reflect on what makes open source truly reliable‚Äîespecially when it matters most.

---

## What Makes Open Source Reliable?

We believe there are two key ingredients that organizations look for when evaluating the reliability of an open-source project:

### 1. **Good Governance**

Any mature open-source project needs clear structure, transparency, and community input. You want to know who's steering the ship, how decisions are made, and what the long-term vision looks like.

We're proud to say that [**Kairos achieved this last year**](https://kairos.io/blog/2024/10/08/kairos-joins-the-cncf-as-a-sandbox-project/), when we became a [CNCF Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). This step formalized our commitment to open governance, transparency, and alignment with the broader cloud-native ecosystem.

Being in the CNCF means more than a logo or badge‚Äîit means Kairos is on a clear track for growth, with expectations for documentation, contributor diversity, release quality, and more. It means we're not going it alone‚Äîwe're growing with a foundation of best practices and mentorship.

### 2. **Professional Support Options**

Even with the best community and codebase, some organizations simply need a support contract to move forward‚Äîespecially in regulated industries, large enterprises, or mission-critical edge environments.

Until now, our community has relied on best-effort support through GitHub, Slack, and community contributions. That's still available and thriving.

But for those who need more?

Now there's an answer.

## Announcing Commercial Support for Kairos

Starting today, you can get **official, SLAd-backed support for Kairos**, delivered by [Spectro Cloud](https://www.spectrocloud.com/solutions/kairos-support)‚Äîthe original creators of Kairos and its primary maintainers.

This support offering is tailored for different levels of need:

- **Basic Tier**: Great for getting started or supporting smaller projects. Includes ticket-based online support with defined SLAs.
- **Production Tier**: Designed for mission-critical deployments. Offers 24√ó7 support, direct engineering access, early access to hotfixes, security updates, and more.

This isn't about transforming Kairos into an enterprise product. **Kairos is already in production at scale.** This move simply creates a bridge‚Äîso more people and teams can adopt Kairos with confidence, whatever their internal requirements may be.

## Why This Matters (Even If You Don't Need Support)

You might be wondering: ‚ÄúI'm not a large enterprise. I don't need SLAs. Why should I care?‚Äù

Here's why this matters for everyone in the Kairos ecosystem:

- **Sustainability**: Commercial support provides a long-term incentive to keep maintaining and investing in the project.
- **Growth**: It signals to adopters of all sizes that Kairos is a serious, credible option‚Äîencouraging more contributors, users, and real-world feedback.
- **Choice**: Most importantly, it gives you options. You can continue using Kairos as you always have‚Äîor choose to engage with professional support when it makes sense for you.

We believe open source isn't just about free software. It's about **freedom**‚Äîto build, to learn, to choose, and to scale.

## What's Next?

This milestone is just one step in a broader journey.

We want to continue maturing Kairos and reach CNCF Incubation‚Äîa critical next phase in the project‚Äôs evolution. To do that, we need to keep growing the community, broadening adoption, and building deeper collaboration.

So we‚Äôre putting out a call:

üîî If you‚Äôre a company invested in Kairos, there are two key ways you can help:

Contribute Maintainers
If you're already using Kairos in your products or infrastructure, chances are you're making improvements, tooling, or fixes internally. Why not share that value with the broader community? We invite you to become a maintainer, help guide the roadmap, and collaborate with us to shape the future of edge Linux together.

Become a Support Partner
If you‚Äôre recommending Kairos to your customers and helping them succeed with it, we‚Äôd love to recognize your role. Let‚Äôs work together to include your organization in our list of Kairos support partners‚Äîmaking it clear that help is available from more than one source, and encouraging adoption from companies that want a trusted hand.

Let‚Äôs continue building Kairos as an open, shared foundation‚Äîone that scales with our collective ambition.
